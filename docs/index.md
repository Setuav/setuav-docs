# Setuav Docs

Setuav is a UAV design and engineering analysis platform. It combines parametric aircraft geometry definition, component-driven propulsion setup, and physics-based analysis in a single workflow so teams can iterate from concept to performance evaluation with consistent assumptions.

## Key Features

- Unified analysis pipeline for aerodynamics, propulsion, and flight performance
- Section/profile-based parametric geometry definition for wing and fuselage modeling
- Consistent geometry-mapping layer that converts design geometry into analysis-ready models
- Physics-based propulsion solving with coupled motor-propeller-battery behavior
- Velocity-sweep flight performance outputs (envelope, climb, range, endurance)
- Structured configuration model for reproducible analysis runs
- Documentation organized by domain for scalable future expansion
